# Rebalanced-Direct-Investment
After writing a post on my problems with Direct Investment costs in the balance discussion board, I decided to make a mod that implements my suggestions as a general proof of concept. The effects of this mod are as follows:

*Base investment money cost for the Economy, Welfare, Knowledge, and Unity priorities is population divided by 1 million
*Base investment money cost for the Military priority is 100 per maximum number of armies + 100 for every miltech level over 2
*Base investment money cost for all other priorities is 300
*Base investment influence cost is 3 * number of control points
*Like before, these costs are then modified by corruption, percentage of control points owned by the investing faction, and faction-specific modifiers

These effects make Direct Investment a viable use of resources rather than just a late-game money sink. The cost of investing in scaling priorities now scales with the size of the country so that the cost of investment scales with the results, while investing in non-scaling priorities is roughly the same for all countries. Influence costs for DI are generally higher, and combined with the lower money costs give you something on which to spend your late-game influence income.
